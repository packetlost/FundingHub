## Concepts
The structure of this contract and dApp relies upon a few concepts that deserve explanation:
* **Decentralized Product Hash (DPH)**: We've indexed the products in the productList using a SHA3 hash of the title, [GPC Segment](http://www.gs1.org/gpc), and creator's address. This is an early attempt at standardizing product ID's/Indexes for the purpose of making searchability and provable identity possible in the future. Suggestions for improving this standard are welcome.
* **Global Product Classification (GPC)**: For prodcut categorization we are relying on the [GS1 GPC standard](http://www.gs1.org/gpc) of catetegorization to make our marketplace compatible with existing standards.

## Current Limitations
* Large Product / Shop sets become increasingly burdensome/expensive to iterate over for display frontend
* All pricing is in ETH
* No search
* No delivery / shipping fulfillment

## Unsolved Challenges
1. Providing searchability to products and orders.
  * We currently don't have an easy way for looking through the productList and attempting to match keywords to the fields in the Prodcut struct. Using the **DPH** allows for some primitive search, assuming the user knows the Title, Category, and Creator address.
  * The same is true for Orders
2. Maintaining privacy of orders so that only the order initiator and merchant can access order details.
  * As all order details exist on the public blockchain, it is feasible for anyone to find access to the order data of any user.


## Todo
* Input Validation (UX)
* Test Coverage
* Display all orders to administrator (UX)
* Function to update order status (Contract + UX)
* Display Customer orders (UX)
* Support for co-purchasing (Contract + UX)
* Support for 3rd-party tokens (Contract + UX)
* Handle non-scarce products that do not need stock counts
* Support for multiple categories per product (Contract)
* Support delivery of products and tracking
* Real image support via IPFS
